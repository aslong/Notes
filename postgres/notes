Joins:

  Inner join - you specify two columns to be equal to join two tables and only return the results
  that have matches.

    SELECT e.title, v.name
    FROM events e JOIN venues v
    ON e.venue_id = v.venue_id

Outer Joins:

  Outer Left join - you specify two columns to be equal to join two tables and return all the rows
  from the left table regardless of if the two columns are equal. However results from the right
  table will only be displayed where there is a match in the left table.

    SELECT e.title, v.name
    FROM events e LEFT JOIN venues v
    ON e.venue_id = v.venue_id

  Outer Right join - Is similar to a right join except the right tables rows are all returned and
  joined only with the rows in the left table that match the ON statement.

    SELECT e.title, v.name
    FROM events e RIGHT JOIN venues v
    ON e.venue_id = v.venue_id

  Full Outer join - Return all of the rows from both tables and only join together the rows that
  match the ON statement.

    SELECT e.title, v.name
    FROM events e FULL JOIN venues v
    ON e.venue_id = v.venue_id

Index types:

  hash - similar to a hashmap or map. Only works efficiently for exact matches. Doesn't handle
  range queries.

  btree - uses a binary tree structure. Because of the tree structure, ranges can be searched
  with efficiently.
